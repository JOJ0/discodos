I just released a new version of my "AKAI MPC 1000 sequence file command line utility".

{% include figure.html filename='/images/2018-4-15-mpc1k-seq/IMG_0461.jpg' alt_text='some sequences on the MPC' caption='' width="49%" float="left" margin="4.5px 10px 0 0" img_style="border: 5px solid #303030; //rgb(255, 129, 173);" %}

Probably the biggest news is that you now don't need any form of Python installed on your computer, because I provide executable files for MacOS and Windows that contain all the Python stuff the tool needs. Full release notes and download here: [mpc1k-seq version 1.2](https://github.com/JOJ0/mpc1k-seq/releases/tag/v1.2)

Read what this tool is actually about in the [updated original blog post]({% post_url 2018-4-15-mpc1k-seq %}).

And as always: your valuable feedback is appreciated!
