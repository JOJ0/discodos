DiscoDOS helps a DJ remember and analyze what they played in their sets, or what they could possibly play in the future. It's based on data pulled from a users [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com) record [collection](https://support.discogs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007331534-How-Does-The-Collection-Feature-Work-). Tracks can be organized into playlists and mix-transitions rated. Additionally the collection can be linked to the online music information services [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) and [AcousticBrainz](https://acousticbrainz.org), thus further information (like musical key and BPM) is made available to the user.

DiscoDOS currently is available as a command line tool only, though prototypes of a mobile and a desktop app exist already. Despite of what the name implies, it's just the look that is reminiscent of the 80s/90s operating system, its usability follows most standards of a typical [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)#Unix-like_systems) utility you would find on a [UNIX-like operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like).

DiscoDOS runs on current Linux, macOS and Windows systems.

DiscoDOS primarily aims at the Vinyl DJ but feature ideas for DJ's playing both, digital media and vinyl, are existing. Also thoughts around GUI programming and alternative approaches to finding out key and BPM are present. Have a look on the DiscoDOS website's [roadmap](https://discodos.jojotodos.net#roadmap) chapter.
