Hi, my name is J0J0, I am a self taught musician, DJ, Open Source aficionado, Linux Sysadmin and recently started to build and hack electronic things. Most of my knowledge of anything I got from the internet. Now it&#39;s time to give something back: This is my blog, I hope you find it useful.

Find me on various other platforms:
