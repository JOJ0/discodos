This is the story of a robots life. 

It was born in an old Saline in Hallein Austria...

... but its parents wouldn't let it live its dream.... it should attend a carreer as a Robo-Sumo-Fighter like its father and its grandmother did (they all were really bad at it and didn't earn much fame obviously!)

{% include thumb.html filename='/images/2017-9-24-das-adhs/IMG_5308.jpg' alt_text='' caption='It had to fight against evil creatures, ...' width="49%" float="left" %}

</div>
<br>

{% include youtube.html id="xg1r3PN7qE8" width="100%" %}
So it came that one day "Das ADHS" had enough....
<br><br>

<div class="clearfix">
{% include thumb.html filename='/images/2017-9-24-das-adhs/IMG_5376.jpg' alt_text='' caption='Yes! It just ran off the ring and let the fighting be. It was struggling with itself, hanging around on the television for months, drinking, drugs, you kown the game...' width="100%" float="none" %}
</div>
<br>

...after a while (it must have been a year or two) it managed to get itself together and did what it always should have done: It became a stage dancer with a famous rock band.

  </ul>

### Materials

clip off some pins from these to use as male and female connectors

[20 pin inline socket](https://www.musikding.de/20-Pin-inline-socket)<br>
[10 pin strip](https://www.musikding.de/10-Pin-strip)<br>
[3 pin strip](https://www.musikding.de/3-Pin-strip)<br>

The male ones are also called "pin headers". 

The 7-segment displays I got from somewhere in China (aliexpress), but you will find them in most of electronics stores, or just recycle them from some old device. They are found in a lot of things. 

The rechargeable button cells I also found somewhere on aliexpress, I suppose they are not very common around here. In some of the pics you see that I use two standard AA batteries to power the displays on the breadboard. You just need to get some kind of battery holder, eg [this](https://secure.reichelt.at/batteriehalter-fuer-2-mignonzellen-aa-mit-anschlusskabel-halter-2xum3-ka-p176721.html?)
